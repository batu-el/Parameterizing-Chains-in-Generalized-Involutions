# Online Appendix: Parameterizing Chains in Fixed point Free Generalized Involutions
This is the online appendix for my undergraduate Honors Thesis in Mathematics. I generated examples of W-sets, which you can see on Notebook 15, to formulate a conjecture about the simple rule to construct the W-sets of Generalized fixed-point-free (FPF) involutions. In Notebook 15, I put the relevant functions on a single file for convenience. In my thesis, I prove this result and establish it as an original Theorem. If you are interested in reading the thesis please send an email to bel [at] tulane [dot] edu. I'd be happy to share my work with you. Currently, I am working on a publication which will feature the results on my thesis. This work will further generalize my finding to involutions that have fixed-points. I will post the link here once that is done.
